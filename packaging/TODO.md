ezResume: TODO List Overview
============================

Presuming you've forked / downloaded this repo and setup your own GitHub repo.


0) If you intend on having a GitHub Pages page: http://pages.github.com.


1) Prepare your resume (or CV) as a .md file within your repo. You can name it whatever you want. You don't have to use RESUME.md.

- Suggestion: Instead of RESUME.md do something like: Resume-Your-Name.md.

- GH markdown cheatsheets are everywhere. This one feels like one of the better ones: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.


2) Open the index.html and fill out the TODOs. 

- Note: Many of the TODOs are SEO and/or social share related. If you're not interested in that stuff, just remove what you don't want.

- Suggestion: Take the 5 - 10 minutes and fill out the TODOs. It's not going to hurt you, and it can only help you. 

- Recommendation: That said, if you must trim things, at the very least keep the <title> and the <meta description>.


3) If you wish to make addition changes to the CSS: css / ezresume.css.

- Note: The template is intentioanlly barebones. Fancy fonts and colors are nice but take time and can also be distracting. You're the hightlight, not the page's design. 


4) That's it. The objective here is simple: Once the setup is completed all you have to maintain is the markdown file with your resume (or CV). And GitHub gives you a free page for displaying that. Perfect, right?


p.s. If you like this idea, please tell your friends about it. If you tweet it, be sure to mention #ezResume and @ezWebDevTools. Thanks.
